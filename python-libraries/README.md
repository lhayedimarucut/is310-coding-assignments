This script allows you to save your favorite dishes and enter in the recipes for them.

To run the script enter 'python cli_data_entry.py'
It will prompt you to enter in your dish, the ingredients, cook time, serves, and instructions.
Afterwards, your script should soon turn into a json file where you will find your recipe!
