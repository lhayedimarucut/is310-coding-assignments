		<p>Meet Stanley, my energetic and curious 3-month-old Dachshund. Though still small, Stanley has a big personalityâ€”always eager to explore
		his surroundings and have massive zoomies, where he chases after his toys like crazy. Whether he's learning new tricks every week, cuddling up during
		a nap, or chewing up his toys, his playful and loving spirit makes him an absolute joy!</p>

		<p>As a first-time dog owner, I've been trying my best to get as much information as I can to make sure Stanley and I both stay happy and healthy. Some
		of the things I've been making sure he gets are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Feed him 2 to 3 times a day </li>
 			<li>Treats for positive reinforcement</li>
			<li>Lots of love</li>
		</ul>
