I chose to do this wiki fandom because growing up I loved to watch 
Strawberry Shortcake. I noticed when watching these shows, that Strawberry 
always had a lot of friends. This would be helpful in listing all her 
friends and how her realtionships with them.
For the wiki fandom, I decided to use the Strawberry ShortCake Berry Bitty 
compared to the top one which was just the original Strawberry Shortcake 
charachter. I found that while trying to web scrape that website, it was 
hard for me to figure out exactly how to pin point each of her friends. 
The Berry Bitty wiki fandom page had a heading correlating to her friends 
and they were all in a list format. The only issue was trying to 
differentate the name vs the description of her friend. However I was able 
to figure it out by making sure it knew to slice by the ':' or '-'.

For research purposes, I think it would just be a fun thing to look at if you might be looking to research about childhood tv shows. Like for example, someone could research friends of the main charachter and how these name are often very creative and their relations with them help build themes around positive morals to teach kids.
